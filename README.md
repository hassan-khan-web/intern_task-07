In this task, I created a simple sales summary using Python and SQL. I used SQLite to build a small database file called sales_data.db with one table named sales. I inserted a few dummy rows with sample product names, quantities sold, and prices.

I then wrote a Python script (which can be run as a .py file or in a Jupyter Notebook) that connects to the database using sqlite3. With SQL queries, I calculated the total quantity sold and the total revenue for each product. I loaded this result into a pandas DataFrame, printed the output, and plotted it as a basic bar chart using matplotlib and seaborn.

This covered the entire objective as given: to pull simple sales info using SQL inside Python and display it with print and a basic chart. I also included the option to save the chart if needed.

The tools I used were Python, sqlite3 (built-in), pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Everything matches the deliverables described in the task, helping me practice SQL queries, pandas data handling, and simple data visualization all in one small project.

I have provided both .py file and .ipynb file, a image of the graph ploted and the interview questions.

 for referance I used Google, ChatGPT, Deepseek, YouTube. 
 for tools I used SQLite, ChatGPT, Deepseek, GitHub, Excel, MS word, Python(pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlite3).
